...but on the internet, I also go by `defsectec` (for software, security, and other
technical stuff) and `narf9995` (for RPGS and other games).

I currently work at a pediatric hospital as a Patient Watch Specialist & formerly worked as a martial arts instructor.

I like computers, physical/network security, defense, industry, Tabletop RPGs, & food. (I construct games [here](/tabletop/), and write down my recipes [here](/recipes/)).

I'm originally from Seattle, WA, USA, and continue to live there for the forseeable future.

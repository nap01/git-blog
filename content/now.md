# What I'm Doing Right Now

Currently I'm focusing on improving and taking care of myself during a difficult period of my life. Most of the projects I'm working on directly benefit that cause or are for entertainment.

## Improving Physical/Mental Health

Building healthier routines and patterns.

## Education/Work

I am currently working on my CompTIA A+ & Linux+. Then I intend to take a Industrial Cybersecurity course at a local community college. Additionally, I want intend to get a CCNA once the CompTIA certs. are complete.

## Digital/Physical Organization

Even though I have been a tech enthusiast my whole life, I have always had a partially functional, hobbled-together setup. So I am trying to rectify that by getting all my computer junk in order and getting rid of the excess. This is also true for the rest of my possesions, currenly I am trying to downsize as much as possible, within reason.

&lt;p>I liked the look/function of &lt;a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog&lt;/a>, but wanted to be able to write in markdown and liked the idea of using GitHub to manage/host the files. I had had difficulties with GitHub Pages in the past, so I thought I would try out Netlify after I learned about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took a bit of time to trouble shoot things as I was trying to get &lt;a href="https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog">hugo-bearblog&lt;/a> to work with the Netlify + Hugo Quickstart template. That was a deadend no matter how many different aveneues I attempted. Eventually I just created an empty GitHub repo via the web interface, cloned it to my local machine, initialized a hugo site in the git directory, added hugo-bearblog as a git submodule, and copied over the contents of the example site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I pushed that back to the git repo and Netlify quickly built and hosted the website. After confirming it worked, I swapped the example content for a barebones version of my own. I plan to expand on most parts of the website ASAP, but need to take a break as I have spent a decent amount of time getting this to build on Netlify.&lt;/p></content></entry></feed>
